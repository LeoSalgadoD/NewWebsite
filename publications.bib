	abstract = {Cultivar resistance is a key management strategy for the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), the primary pest in Louisiana sugarcane, but mechanisms of resistance are not well understood. This research evaluated the potential mechanisms of cultivar resistance to D. saccharalis among commercially produced sugarcane cultivars and experimental lines through three field screenings, two greenhouse experiments, and one diet incorporation assay.The resistant standards HoCP 85-845, HoCP 04-838, and L 01-299 were among the cultivars with the lowest D. saccharalis injury levels in both field and greenhouse trials. Cultivars HoCP 00-950 and L 12-201 were among the most heavily injured in both trials. Differences in oviposition among cultivars in the greenhouse choice study were not detected, suggesting adult preference is not a key factor in resistance. This was also supported by the no-choice greenhouse experiment in which up to 9-fold differences in neonate establishment among cultivars were detected. Larval injury among cultivars in greenhouse experiments was consistent with field studies suggesting traits that affect neonate establishment (e.g., rind hardness) help to confer resistance in the field. In the diet incorporation assay, lower larval weights and longer time to pupation were observed on resistant cultivar Ho 08-9003, but no differences were found among current commercial cultivars. Continuous evaluation of cultivar resistance to D. saccharalis is important in developing effective integrated pest management strategies for this pest. More research into plant characteristics (e.g., leaf sheath tightness and pubescence) associated with resistance is needed.},

	abstract = {Cultivar resistance is an essential management strategy for the Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), in sugarcane in the USA, but resistance mechanisms are poorly understood. Resistance was evaluated among Louisiana’s (USA) commercial sugarcane cultivars and experimental clones through ﬁeld screenings, greenhouse trials, and a diet incorporation assay. Cultivars L 01-299 and HoCP 85-845 had the lowest borer injury levels, while HoCP 00-950 and L 12-201 were among the most heavily injured in ﬁeld and greenhouse trials. The variability of results between the two ﬁeld trials suggests that a genotype × environment interaction might affect the expression of resistance. Oviposition did not differ among evaluated cultivars in the greenhouse choice study. Results from the no-choice experiment showed that neonatal establishment differed among cultivars by up to 3-fold. In a diet incorporation assay, all cultivars reduced larval weight up to 86.5\% and increased days to pupation by 1.8-fold relative to the diet-only control. Collectively, these results suggest that Louisiana’s sugarcane breeding germplasm contains various resistance levels to E. loftini, emphasizing the importance of screening cultivars before they are released to growers. Future studies should try to determine the inﬂuence of environmental factors on resistance expression.},

	abstract = {Aerial blight, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG) 1-IA, is an economically important soybean disease in the midSouthern United States. Management has relied on fungicide applications during the season, but there is an increasing prevalence of resistance to commonly used strobilurin fungicides and an urgent need to identify soybean varieties resistant to aerial blight. Because the patchy distribution of the pathogen complicates ﬁeld variety screening, the present study aimed to develop a greenhouse screening protocol to identify soybean varieties resistant to aerial blight. For this, 88 pathogen isolates were collected from commercial ﬁelds and research farms across ﬁve Louisiana parishes, and 77\% were conﬁrmed to be R. solani AG1-IA. Three polymorphic codominant microsatellite markers were used to explore the genetic diversity of 43 R. solani AG1-IA isolates, which showed high genetic diversity, with 35 haplotypes in total and only two haplotypes common to two other locations. Six genetically diverse isolates were chosen and characterized for their virulence and fungicide sensitivity. The isolate AC2 was identiﬁed as the most virulent and was resistant to both active ingredients, azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, tested. The six isolates were used in greenhouse variety screening trials using a millet inoculation protocol. Of the 31 varieties screened, only Armor 48-D25 was classiﬁed as moderately resistant, and plant height to the ﬁrst node inﬂuenced ﬁnal disease severity. The study provides short-term solutions for growers to choose less susceptible varieties for planting and lays the foundation to characterize host resistance against this important soybean pathogen.},

	abstract = {The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is the primary pest of sugarcane, Saccharum spp., in much of North and South America. Control of D. saccharalis can be obtained through judicious application of insecticides, but more research is needed to optimize chemical control strategies. A series of field trials evaluated the duration of protection and influence of application water volume on D. saccharalis control in Louisiana sugarcane from 2018 to 2020. Results across trials demonstrated superior control was achieved with chlorantraniliprole over novaluron and tebufenozide. Analysis of insecticide concentrations present in leaf sheath tissue of the target internode suggests chlorantraniliprole and novaluron are achieving systemic activity, but not tebufenozide. Chlorantraniliprole concentrations remained above lethal levels for more than 8 wk after application. The percentage of bored internodes was 1.3- and 1.9-fold greater following applications with a water volume of 18.7 L/ha relative to those made with 46.7 and 186.8 L/ha, respectively, across insecticides. Collectively, results suggest chlorantraniliprole applied early in the season with sufficient water volume can provide nearly season-long protection of sugarcane against D. saccharalis injury.},

	abstract = {Onion maggot, Delia antiqua (Meigen), is a significant constraint on onion production across the temperate regions of North America. Early season infestations can reduce plant stands up to 75\% if untreated. Effective management of D. antiqua has historically relied on insecticide seed treatments, with spinosad being among the most commonly used options. However, declining control efficacy observed on a New York onion farm over several years raised concerns about the potential development of insecticide resistance. The purpose of this research was to (i) evaluate the efficacy of spinosad seed treatment in managing D. antiqua in the affected field from 2021 to 2024 and (ii) to assess the population’s susceptibility to spinosad using a laboratory bioassay. Results from field trials revealed that the percentage of control of D. antiqua using spinosad seed treatment relative to a noninsecticide treatment declined from 51\% in 2021 to −83\% in 2024. Laboratory bioassay results showed an increase in LC50 values from insects collected from nontreated and spinosad-treated plants in 2023. These results document the first case of reduction in spinosad seed treatment efficacy in D. antiqua that has practical consequences for pest control (practical resistance). Given the critical role of spinosad seed treatment in onion maggot management, these results underscore the need for evaluating resistance prevalence in other populations across North America.},
